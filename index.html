        What's missing is a conducive environment.

            TopRank is self-driven. During the duration of the program hackers can 
            work individually, collaboratively, or both on projects that excite them. 
            There will be some instructional classes and assignments, but not enough 
            to take away the freedom required to pursue individual ambitions.
