        <div>
            Admission is open to Ghanaian citizens and residents only.
            There's a total of 12 spots available per batch. We run 2
            batches per year. We open applications for both batches at
            the same time. Applicants choose which batch they're
            applying for. We also keep a waiting list, in case accepted
            participants drop out before start of program. On rare
            occasions, we may exceed batch size by one or two.
        </div>

        <div>
            Per batch, half the spots are dedicated to returning
            participants. We don't expect a lot of uptake here since we
            try to encourage our previous participants to return as
            resident experts for their previous projects. Resident
            experts rework on the projects, allowing them to draw deeper
            insights, given the extra responsibility they have to guide
            newer participants.
